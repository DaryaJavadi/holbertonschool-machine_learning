# 📊 Project Summary

This project focuses on key evaluation metrics used in `Natural Language Processing (NLP)` to assess model performance. It covers metrics like `Accuracy`, `Precision`, `Recall`, `F1-Score` for `classification`; `BLEU` and `ROUGE` for text generation; and Perplexity for language modeling. Through examples and experiments, the project highlights how choosing the right metric is crucial for evaluating different `NLP` tasks effectively.

# ℹ️ Random Information 

- **Repository Name**: holbertonschool-machine_learning 
- **Description**:  
  This repository is a comprehensive collection of my machine learning work completed during my time at Holberton School. It demonstrates my practical understanding of key concepts in machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

  Machine learning is a field of study that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions with minimal human intervention.

  - `Supervised learning` involves training a system using labeled data, allowing it to learn the relationship between inputs and known outputs.  
  - `Unsupervised learning` focuses on exploring data without predefined labels, aiming to discover hidden patterns or groupings within the data.  
  - `Reinforcement learning` centers around learning through interaction with an environment, where a system receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties to improve its performance over time.

  This repository includes tasks and solutions implemented primarily in Python using libraries like NumPy, serving as a demonstration of my technical ability and understanding of foundational machine learning principles.
