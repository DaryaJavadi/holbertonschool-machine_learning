    Converts a list of sentences into a bag-of-words embedding matrix.

    Parameters:
        sentences (list of str): A list of input text strings.
        vocab (list of str, optional):
        A predefined vocabulary. If None, the vocabulary
        is determined from the sentences.

              A 2D NumPy array where each row represents the bag-of-words
              embedding of a sentence.

                The list of feature names (i.e., vocabulary terms).
