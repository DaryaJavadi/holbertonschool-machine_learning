    Trains a Word2Vec model on the given sentences.

    Parameters:
        sentences (list of list of str):
            Tokenized text data, where each inner list
            represents a sentence as a list of words.

        size (int): Dimensionality of the word vectors.

        min_count (int):
        Ignores all words with total frequency lower than this.

        window (int):
        Maximum distance between the current and predicted
        word within a sentence.

        negative (int):
        Number of negative samples to use (for negative sampling).

        cbow (bool): If True, uses the Continuous Bag of Words architecture.
                     If False, uses the Skip-gram model.

        iterations (int): Number of iterations (epochs) over the corpus.

        seed (int): Seed for the random number generator.

        workers (int): Number of worker threads to train the model.

    Returns:
        gensim.models.Word2Vec: A trained Word2Vec model.
