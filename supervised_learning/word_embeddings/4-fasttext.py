    Trains a FastText model on the given sentences.

    Parameters:
        sentences (list of list of str):
            Tokenized text data, where each inner list
            represents a sentence as a list of words.
        size (int): Dimensionality of the word vectors.
        min_count (int): Ignores all words with total frequency lower
                        than this.
        window (int): Maximum distance between the current and predicted
                      word within a sentence.
        negative (int): Number of negative samples to use
                        (for negative sampling).
        cbow (bool): If True, uses the Continuous Bag of Words architecture.
                     If False, uses the Skip-gram model.
        iterations (int): Number of iterations (epochs) over the corpus.
        seed (int): Seed for the random number generator.
        workers (int): Number of worker threads to train the model.

    Returns:
        gensim.models.FastText: A trained FastText model.
