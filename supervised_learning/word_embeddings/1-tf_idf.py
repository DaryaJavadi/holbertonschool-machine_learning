    Converts a list of sentences into a TF-IDF embedding matrix.

    Parameters:
        sentences (list of str): A list of input text strings.
        vocab (list of str, optional):
        A predefined vocabulary. If None, the vocabulary
        is learned from the sentences.

              A 2D NumPy array where each row represents the TF-IDF
              embedding of a sentence.
